        <h2>1. Project Summary</h2>
        <p>This report documents the methodology and results of a post-fire landslide susceptibility analysis for the Pacific Palisades area in Los Angeles County, California. Following a significant wildfire event on January 7, 2025, this analysis was conducted to identify areas at elevated risk of landslides and debris flows, providing critical information for emergency management and mitigation efforts.</p>
        
        <p>Using a multi-factor analysis approach within ArcGIS Pro, this study integrated topographic, hydrologic, soil, and fire perimeter data to create a comprehensive landslide susceptibility model. The results identify zones of varying landslide risk throughout the study area, with particular focus on regions where fire impacts have significantly altered the landscape's natural stability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Project Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify areas at high risk of post-fire landslides in the Pacific Palisades region</li>
            <li>Quantify the influence of various geomorphometric and hydrologic factors on landslide susceptibility</li>
            <li>Create a comprehensive mapping product showing landslide risk zones for emergency management use</li>
            <li>Develop a systematic and reproducible methodology for post-fire landslide risk assessment</li>
            <li>Provide a framework for ongoing monitoring of high-risk areas</li>

        <h3>5.2 Terrain Analysis</h3>
        <p>Terrain derivatives were calculated from the Digital Elevation Model to identify topographic characteristics that influence landslide susceptibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slope:</strong> Calculated in degrees, with steeper slopes receiving higher risk values</li>
            <li><strong>Aspect:</strong> Direction of slope face, with south-facing slopes typically receiving higher risk values due to greater solar exposure and potential drying effects</li>
            <li><strong>Curvature:</strong> Analysis of profile and plan curvature to identify concave slopes and convergent topography that may concentrate water flow</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.3 Hydrologic Analysis</h3>
        <p>Hydrologic factors were derived to understand water flow patterns that can trigger landslides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flow Direction:</strong> Identified the direction of water flow across the landscape</li>
            <li><strong>Flow Accumulation:</strong> Quantified areas of flow concentration with values ranging from 0-535,817</li>
            <li><strong>Stream Network:</strong> Extracted using a threshold value of 1,000 accumulation cells</li>
            <li><strong>Topographic Wetness Index (TWI):</strong> Calculated to identify areas prone to water accumulation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.4 Soil Risk Analysis</h3>
        <p>Soil factors were analyzed based on properties relevant to landslide potential:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slope Component:</strong> Derived from Field15 values (5.17% to 19.49%)</li>
            <li><strong>Drainage Component:</strong> Assessed from Field17 drainage classification</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrologic Group Component:</strong> Incorporated from Field18 (A, B, C, D groups)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.5 Fire Impact Assessment</h3>
        <p>The fire perimeter was incorporated to account for areas where vegetation loss and soil property changes would increase landslide risk. Burned areas received higher risk values in the weighted analysis.</p>

                <p class="map-description">The slope map displays the steepness of terrain measured in degrees. Slope is a primary factor in landslide susceptibility, with steeper slopes generally having higher landslide potential. Red areas indicate steeper slopes (>30°), which have the highest landslide risk, while green areas represent more gentle slopes with lower risk. This derivative was a major component (30% weight) in the final susceptibility model.</p>

                <p class="map-description">The aspect map shows the compass direction that slopes face. Aspect influences soil moisture retention, vegetation recovery, and exposure to rainfall, all factors that can affect landslide susceptibility. South-facing slopes (shown in warmer colors) typically receive more solar radiation, potentially leading to drier conditions, while north-facing slopes (cooler colors) retain moisture longer. This parameter received a 10% weight in the final model.</p>

                <p class="map-description">The curvature map illustrates the convexity or concavity of the landscape. Concave areas (negative values, shown in blue) tend to concentrate water flow and materials, often increasing landslide potential. Convex areas (positive values, shown in red) typically disperse water flow. This derivative helps identify locations where water and materials might accumulate. Curvature received a 15% weight in the final susceptibility model.</p>

Brighter areas represent higher flow accumulation, indicating potential stream channels and drainage paths where water concentrates. These areas often have higher moisture content and pore pressure, increasing landslide likelihood. This factor received a 15% weight in the final model and was especially important for identifying potential debris flow channels in post-fire conditions.</p>

        <h3>6.6 Risk Distribution Analysis</h3>
        <p>The weighted overlay analysis produced a landslide susceptibility raster with values ranging from 1 to 8. These were classified into four risk categories:</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Risk Category</th>
                <th>Value Range</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span class="risk-level risk-low"></span>Low Risk</td>
                <td>1-2</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span class="risk-level risk-moderate"></span>Moderate Risk</td>
                <td>3-4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span class="risk-level risk-high"></span>High Risk</td>
                <td>5-6</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><span class="risk-level risk-very-high"></span>Very High Risk</td>
                <td>7-8</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>6.2 Key Risk Areas</h3>
        <p>Several areas within the study region were identified as having particularly high landslide susceptibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steep Canyon Areas:</strong> The slopes of major canyons within the burned area show very high risk values, particularly where slopes exceed 18°</li>
            <li><strong>Convergent Topography:</strong> Areas where multiple drainages converge show elevated risk due to flow concentration</li>
            <li><strong>South-facing Burned Slopes:</strong> South-facing slopes within the burn perimeter show higher risk than comparable north-facing slopes</li>
        </ul>

<div class="section">
    <h2>7. Watershed Analysis</h2>
    
    <p>In addition to the pixel-based landslide susceptibility analysis, a preliminary watershed-level assessment was conducted to evaluate the potential for post-fire debris flows. This approach acknowledges that post-fire debris flows and landslides typically follow watershed boundaries and drainage networks.</p>
    
    <h3>7.1 Watershed Delineation Methodology</h3>
    
    <p>Watersheds were delineated using the following workflow:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour points were identified at key drainage outlets where streams exit the study area</li>
        <li>The "Snap Pour Point" tool was used to ensure pour points aligned with the highest flow accumulation paths</li>
        <li>The "Watershed" tool was applied using the flow direction raster to generate watershed boundaries</li>
        <li>Resulting watershed rasters were converted to polygon features for analysis</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="figure">

        <p class="figure-caption">Figure 13: Delineated Watersheds overlayed on Burned Area in the Pacific Palisades Study Area</p>
        <p class="map-description">The map shows the delineated watersheds within the study area. Each watershed represents a distinct drainage basin where water and potentially debris would flow toward a common outlet point. These natural hydrologic units provide a meaningful framework for assessing post-fire landslide and debris flow hazards, as these processes typically follow drainage patterns.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>7.2 Burn Percentage Calculation</h3>
    
    <p>For each delineated watershed, the burn percentage was calculated using the following methodology:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The "Tabulate Area" tool was used to calculate the area of each value within the fire raster for each watershed</li>
        <li>The table was joined to the watershed polygon layer to associate burn statistics with each watershed</li>
        <li>A "Burned_Pct" field was added and calculated to determine the percentage of each watershed affected by fire</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>7.3 Burn Percentage Analysis and Risk Implications</h3>
    
    <p>Analysis of the calculated burn percentages revealed a critical finding:</p>
    
    <div style="background-color: #f9e6e6; border-left: 4px solid #c0392b; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;">
        <strong>Critical Finding:</strong> 99.99-100% of the area within all delineated watersheds was burned in the Pacific Palisades fire event.
    </div>
    
    <p>This comprehensive burn coverage has significant implications for debris flow and landslide risk:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Universal Risk Elevation:</strong> The near-complete burning of all watersheds means that the entire study area must be considered at elevated risk for post-fire debris flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil Hydrophobicity:</strong> Intense heat from the fire likely created water-repellent soil conditions throughout all watersheds, significantly reducing infiltration capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Vegetative Cover:</strong> The comprehensive burning has eliminated the protective vegetative cover across all watersheds, removing the root systems that previously stabilized slopes.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Surface Roughness:</strong> Burned watersheds exhibit lower surface roughness, allowing for more rapid and concentrated runoff during rainfall events.</li>
        <li><strong>Uniform Heightened Sensitivity:</strong> All watersheds in the study area now exhibit uniformly heightened sensitivity to rainfall, with even moderate precipitation potentially triggering debris flows.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>8. Discussion</h2>
        
        <h3>8.1 Key Findings</h3>
        <p>The analysis revealed several important findings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approximately 35% of the burned area shows high or very high landslide susceptibility</li>
            <li>Slope is the dominant factor controlling landslide risk, but its effect is significantly amplified in burned areas</li>
            <li>Areas with convergent topography (concave slopes) and high flow accumulation show particularly elevated risk</li>
            <li>The combination of steep slopes, poor soil drainage, and fire impacts creates the highest risk zones</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>8.2 Model Limitations</h3>
        <p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The analysis is based on a pre-fire DEM, which does not capture terrain changes caused by the fire itself</li>
            <li>Soil data resolution is relatively coarse compared to the DEM</li>
            <li>The model does not account for rainfall intensity or duration, which are critical triggering factors</li>
            <li>Burn severity variations within the fire perimeter are not accounted for</li>
            <li>The analysis represents susceptibility, not probability, of landslide occurrence</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>8.3 Recommendations for Further Analysis</h3>
        <p>To enhance this analysis, several additional steps could be taken:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporate post-fire DEM data to detect actual terrain changes</li>
            <li>Include burn severity data derived from remote sensing (dNBR analysis)</li>
            <li>Develop a rainfall threshold model for triggering conditions</li>
            <li>Conduct field verification at high-risk sites</li>
            <li>Incorporate time-series analysis to track changes throughout the post-fire recovery period</li>
        </ul>
