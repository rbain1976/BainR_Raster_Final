        <h2>1. Project Summary</h2>
        <p>This report documents the methodology and results of a post-fire landslide susceptibility analysis for the Pacific Palisades area in Los Angeles County, California. Following a significant wildfire event on January 7, 2025, which consumed over 1,200 acres of steep coastal terrain, this analysis identifies areas at elevated risk of landslides and debris flows to support emergency management and mitigation efforts.</p>
        
        <p>The Pacific Palisades region has a documented history of slope instability due to its steep topography, fractured sedimentary geology, and seasonal rainfall patterns. The January 2025 fire has significantly increased landslide risk by removing protective vegetation, altering soil properties, and creating hydrophobic soil conditions that reduce infiltration and increase runoff during precipitation events.</p>
        
        <p>Using a multi-factor analysis approach within ArcGIS Pro (version 3.3), this study integrated topographic, hydrologic, soil, and fire perimeter data to create a comprehensive landslide susceptibility model. The results identify zones of varying landslide risk throughout the study area, with particular focus on regions where fire impacts have significantly altered the landscape's natural stability.</p>

            <p class="impact-title">Community Impact</p>
            <p>The January 2025 wildfire in Pacific Palisades had catastrophic effects on entire communities within the region. What were once vibrant neighborhoods with lush vegetation and intact infrastructure have been transformed into charred landscapes of destruction. Over 150 homes were completely destroyed, with hundreds more suffering significant damage. Essential community infrastructure including schools, local businesses, and recreational areas have been rendered unusable. Beyond the immediate structural losses, residents have experienced profound psychological trauma from displacement, loss of possessions, and the destruction of familiar surroundings. The post-fire landscape now presents an ongoing threat to these communities through potential debris flows and landslides, creating a compound disaster scenario where surviving structures and evacuation routes could be compromised during future rainfall events. Recovery efforts will likely take years, requiring significant investment in both physical reconstruction and social support systems to help these communities rebuild.</p>

        <h2>2. Project Objectives</h2>
        <p>This analysis was conducted with the following specific objectives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and map areas at high risk of post-fire landslides in the Pacific Palisades region to support emergency preparedness</li>
            <li>Quantify the influence of various geomorphometric and hydrologic factors on landslide susceptibility</li>
            <li>Create a comprehensive mapping product showing landslide risk zones for emergency management use</li>
            <li>Develop a systematic and reproducible methodology for post-fire landslide risk assessment using GIS technology</li>
            <li>Provide a framework for ongoing monitoring of high-risk areas throughout the post-fire recovery period</li>
            <li>Integrate watershed-level analysis to better understand potential debris flow pathways and impacts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Study Area</h2>
        <p>The Pacific Palisades is an affluent coastal neighborhood in the western part of Los Angeles, situated between the Santa Monica Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. The area is characterized by:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geology:</strong> Primarily composed of marine sedimentary rocks of the Monterey Formation, with some areas of Santa Monica Slate. These formations are naturally prone to weathering and erosion.</li>
            <li><strong>Topography:</strong> Steep terrain with deeply incised canyons, slopes often exceeding 25 degrees, and elevations ranging from sea level to approximately 450 meters.</li>
            <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. Annual precipitation averages 350-450mm, with most rainfall occurring between November and March.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetation:</strong> Pre-fire vegetation consisted primarily of chaparral and coastal sage scrub communities, which provide critical slope stability through extensive root systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> The area has experienced multiple destructive landslides in the past, including major events in 1978, 1998, and 2005, all associated with heavy rainfall following dry periods.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The January 7, 2025 wildfire spread rapidly through the area during strong Santa Ana wind conditions, consuming approximately 1,200 acres of vegetation before being contained on January 10, 2025. The fire was particularly intense on south-facing slopes, where complete vegetation burn was observed.</p>

        <h3>4.1 Digital Elevation Model (DEM)</h3>
        <div class="data-source">
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> USGS 3DEP via The National Map</p>
            <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> 10 meters (1/3 arc-second)</p>
            <p><strong>Vertical Accuracy:</strong> ±1.55m RMSE</p>
            <p><strong>Coordinate System:</strong> NAD 1983 UTM Zone 11N</p>
            <p><strong>Format:</strong> GeoTIFF</p>
            <p><strong>Collection Date:</strong> 2022</p>
            <p><strong>Processing:</strong> The DEM was clipped to the study area and reprojected to NAD 1983 UTM Zone 11N for accurate distance and area measurements. Void filling and edge smoothing were performed to ensure continuous surface representation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>4.2 Fire Perimeter Data</h3>
        <div class="data-source">
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> CALFIRE Fire Perimeters database</p>
            <p><strong>Format:</strong> Vector polygon (File Geodatabase)</p>
            <p><strong>Attributes Used:</strong> Fire boundary, burned area, fire dates, fire name</p>
            <p><strong>Processing:</strong> The fire perimeter was extracted for the specific Pacific Palisades fire event and clipped to the study area. The polygon was converted to raster format at 10m resolution to match the DEM for weighted overlay analysis.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>4.3 Soil Data</h3>
        <div class="data-source">
            <p><strong>Source:</strong> NRCS Digital General Soil Map (STATSGO2)</p>
            <p><strong>Format:</strong> Vector polygon with attribute tables</p>
            <p><strong>Scale:</strong> 1:250,000</p>
            <p><strong>Key Attributes:</strong> Slope (Field15: 5.17% to 19.49%), drainage characteristics (Field17), hydrologic soil group (Field18: A, B, C, D)</p>
            <p><strong>Quality Notes:</strong> The relatively coarse resolution of soil data compared to the DEM represents a limitation in the analysis. More detailed SSURGO data would be preferable but was not available for the entire study area.</p>
            <p><strong>Processing:</strong> Soil polygons were attributed with landslide risk values based on slope, drainage, and hydrologic group data. Values were normalized to a 1-10 scale for incorporation into the weighted overlay analysis.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Terrain Analysis</h3>
        <p>Terrain derivatives were calculated from the Digital Elevation Model to identify topographic characteristics that influence landslide susceptibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slope:</strong> Calculated in degrees using the ArcGIS Pro Slope tool with planar method. Steeper slopes received higher risk values in the reclassification process. Tool parameters included Z-factor of 1 (as input was in meters) and degree measurement output.</li>
            <li><strong>Aspect:</strong> Direction of slope face calculated using the Aspect tool. South-facing slopes (135°-225°) typically received higher risk values due to greater solar exposure and potential drying effects that can lead to hydrophobic soil conditions. North-facing slopes (315°-45°) received lower values.</li>
            <li><strong>Curvature:</strong> Analysis of profile and plan curvature to identify concave slopes and convergent topography that may concentrate water flow. The Curvature tool was used with default parameters to generate profile, plan, and standard curvature outputs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.3 Hydrologic Analysis</h3>
        <p>Hydrologic factors were derived to understand water flow patterns that can trigger landslides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flow Direction:</strong> Identified the direction of water flow across the landscape using the Flow Direction tool with D8 method. This critical intermediate layer establishes the foundation for subsequent hydrologic analyses.</li>
            <li><strong>Flow Accumulation:</strong> Quantified areas of flow concentration with values ranging from 0-535,817 using the Flow Accumulation tool. Higher values indicate areas where water concentrates during rainfall events, potentially triggering slope failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Stream Network:</strong> Extracted using a threshold value of 1,000 accumulation cells with the Con tool in Raster Calculator. This threshold was selected after testing multiple values to best represent the actual drainage network visible in the hillshade visualization.</li>
            <li><strong>Topographic Wetness Index (TWI):</strong> Calculated using the formula: ln(flow_accumulation / tan(slope)) to identify areas prone to water accumulation. This index is particularly relevant for post-fire conditions where altered infiltration patterns can create new saturation zones.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.4 Soil Risk Analysis</h3>
        <p>Soil factors were analyzed based on properties relevant to landslide potential:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slope Component:</strong> Derived from Field15 values (5.17% to 19.49%), with higher slopes receiving higher risk scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Drainage Component:</strong> Assessed from Field17 drainage classification, with "Well drained" areas receiving lower risk values (3) compared to areas with poorer drainage (8).</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrologic Group Component:</strong> Incorporated from Field18 (A, B, C, D groups). Group A soils (high infiltration) received values of 2, while Group D soils (low infiltration) received values of 9 to reflect their higher runoff potential.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.5 Fire Impact Assessment</h3>
        <p>The fire perimeter was incorporated to account for areas where vegetation loss and soil property changes would increase landslide risk. Burned areas received higher risk values in the weighted analysis, reflecting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Loss of stabilizing root networks</li>
            <li>Creation of water-repellent soil layers that reduce infiltration</li>
            <li>Reduced ground cover that normally absorbs rainfall energy</li>
            <li>Ash-covered surfaces that can seal soil pores</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.6 Weighted Overlay Analysis</h3>

        </table>
        
        <p>The Weighted Overlay tool was executed with an evaluation scale of 1-10, with all input factors reclassified to match this scale. The weights were implemented as percentages summing to 100%, with each factor's influence proportional to its assigned weight.</p>

        <p>Several areas within the study region were identified as having particularly high landslide susceptibility:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Steep Canyon Areas:</strong> The slopes of major canyons within the burned area show very high risk values, particularly where slopes exceed 18°</li>
            <li><strong>Convergent Topography:</strong> Areas where multiple drainages converge show elevated risk due to flow concentration</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Watershed Analysis</h2>
        
        <p>In addition to the pixel-based landslide susceptibility analysis, a preliminary watershed-level assessment was conducted to evaluate the potential for post-fire debris flows. This approach acknowledges that post-fire debris flows and landslides typically follow watershed boundaries and drainage networks.</p>
        
        <h3>7.1 Watershed Delineation Methodology</h3>
        
        <p>Watersheds were delineated using the following workflow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour points were identified at key drainage outlets where streams exit the study area</li>
            <li>The "Snap Pour Point" tool was used to ensure pour points aligned with the highest flow accumulation paths</li>
            <li>The "Watershed" tool was applied using the flow direction raster to generate watershed boundaries</li>
            <li>Resulting watershed rasters were converted to polygon features for analysis</li>
        </ol>

            <p class="map-description">The map shows the delineated watersheds within the study area. Each watershed represents a distinct drainage basin where water and potentially debris would flow toward a common outlet point. These natural hydrologic units provide a meaningful framework for assessing post-fire landslide and debris flow hazards, as these processes typically follow drainage patterns.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>7.2 Burn Percentage Calculation</h3>
        
        <p>For each delineated watershed, the burn percentage was calculated using the following methodology:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The "Tabulate Area" tool was used to calculate the area of each value within the fire raster for each watershed</li>
            <li>The table was joined to the watershed polygon layer to associate burn statistics with each watershed</li>
            <li>A "Burned_Pct" field was added and calculated to determine the percentage of each watershed affected by fire</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>7.3 Burn Percentage Analysis and Risk Implications</h3>
        
        <p>Analysis of the calculated burn percentages revealed a critical finding:</p>
        
        <div class="alert-box">
            <strong>Critical Finding:</strong> 99.99-100% of the area within all delineated watersheds was burned in the Pacific Palisades fire event.
        </div>
        
        <p>This comprehensive burn coverage has significant implications for debris flow and landslide risk:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Universal Risk Elevation:</strong> The near-complete burning of all watersheds means that the entire study area must be considered at elevated risk for post-fire debris flows.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Hydrophobicity:</strong> Intense heat from the fire likely created water-repellent soil conditions throughout all watersheds, significantly reducing infiltration capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Vegetative Cover:</strong> The comprehensive burning has eliminated the protective vegetative cover across all watersheds, removing the root systems that previously stabilized slopes.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Surface Roughness:</strong> Burned watersheds exhibit lower surface roughness, allowing for more rapid and concentrated runoff during rainfall events.</li>
            <li><strong>Uniform Heightened Sensitivity:</strong> All watersheds in the study area now exhibit uniformly heightened sensitivity to rainfall, with even moderate precipitation potentially triggering debris flows.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Discussion</h2>
        
        <h3>8.1 Key Findings</h3>
        <p>The analysis revealed several important findings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approximately 35% of the burned area shows high or very high landslide susceptibility</li>
            <li>Slope is the dominant factor controlling landslide risk, but its effect is significantly amplified in burned areas</li>
            <li>Areas with convergent topography (concave slopes) and high flow accumulation show particularly elevated risk</li>
            <li>The combination of steep slopes, poor soil drainage, and fire impacts creates the highest risk zones</li>
            <li>Watershed analysis revealed 100% burn coverage across all delineated drainage basins, eliminating the possibility of prioritizing based on burn percentage</li>
            <li>The complete vegetation removal across all watersheds creates a situation where even moderate rainfall events could trigger widespread debris flows</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>8.2 Model Limitations</h3>
        <p>Several limitations should be considered when interpreting these results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The analysis is based on a pre-fire DEM, which does not capture terrain changes caused by the fire itself</li>
            <li>Soil data resolution is relatively coarse (1:250,000) compared to the DEM (10m), potentially masking local soil variations</li>
            <li>The model does not account for rainfall intensity or duration, which are critical triggering factors</li>
            <li>Burn severity variations within the fire perimeter are not accounted for</li>
            <li>The analysis represents susceptibility, not probability, of landslide occurrence</li>
            <li>No field validation was possible within the project timeframe to ground-truth the model predictions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>8.3 Recommendations for Further Analysis</h3>
        <p>To enhance this analysis, several additional steps could be taken:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporate post-fire DEM data to detect actual terrain changes</li>
            <li>Include burn severity data derived from remote sensing (dNBR analysis)</li>

        <h2>9. Conclusion and Emergency Management Implications</h2>
        
        <p>This analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of post-fire landslide susceptibility in the Pacific Palisades area. The results demonstrate that the combination of steep terrain, fire impacts, and hydrologic factors creates conditions favorable for landslides and debris flows. The landslide susceptibility map identifies specific areas of concern that require monitoring and potential mitigation measures.</p>
        
        <p>For emergency management purposes, the following specific recommendations are provided:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Establish Rainfall Thresholds:</strong> Implement conservative rainfall intensity-duration thresholds of 0.5 inches/hour or 1.0 inch in 3 hours as initial warning criteria for potential debris flow activation.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize Evacuation Planning:</strong> Focus evacuation planning on communities downstream of areas identified as "Very High Risk," particularly in canyon bottoms and alluvial fan areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Protection:</strong> Install temporary debris barriers or k-rails to protect critical infrastructure in high-risk zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring Network:</strong> Establish rain gauges and soil moisture sensors in representative watersheds to provide real-time data during rainfall events.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Education:</strong> Develop educational materials for residents about post-fire debris flow hazards and warning signs, including unusual sounds or changes in stream flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery Timeline:</strong> Plan for at least 3-5 years of heightened vigilance, as post-fire debris flow risk typically remains elevated until substantial vegetation recovery occurs.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>This landslide susceptibility analysis provides a scientific foundation for these recommendations, offering emergency managers the spatial intelligence needed to allocate resources effectively and protect lives and property during the critical post-fire recovery period.</p>
